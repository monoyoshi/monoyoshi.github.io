# monoyoshi.github.io 🐉🗡️

hello there!!!!

the name's kyu and I am a hobbyist programmer/web developer and graphic designer. I like to work on personal projects on my free time, and my interests include pokémon, touken ranbu/刀剣乱舞, dragalia lost, and vtubers (ren zotto 😈🛸 and myself 🐉🗡️🧍‍♂️)! nice to meet you!!

as someone on the autism spectrum and (probably) adhd, I like to center what I do around my interests! fueled by messages of forging and cherishing bonds and my own personal experiences as a minority in more ways than one, I want to show the world what some guy like me can do. let's get lost, together!!!!
